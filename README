vnid is a Python script which can be used to retrieve VN titles from VNDB.

vnid can query visual novels and releases. If no prefix is given, "v" is
assumed. The module used for communicating with the VNDB API is vndb_simple.py.
To pack vnid and vndb_simple into a single executable file, type `make`. To
install, do `sudo make install`.
